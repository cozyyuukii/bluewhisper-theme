🎨 Customization

1. Changing the Branding

To make this site your own, open index.html and replace instances of "Yuukii" with your name. Don't forget to update the <title> tag and the meta description!

2. Theming

The color scheme is managed entirely in style.css using CSS variables. You can drastically change the look by editing the :root block:

:root {
    /* Current Theme: BlueWhisper */
    --clr-bg-start: #e6f0f7;       /* Pale Sky Blue - Lighter */
    --clr-bg-end: #d0e0f0;         /* Pale Sky Blue - Darker */
    --clr-primary: #a0c4ff;        /* Pale Cerulean (Main Accent) */
    --clr-secondary: #a3d8d0;      /* Frosted Teal (Secondary Accent) */
    --clr-text-dark: #3a4d6f;      /* Headings */
}
